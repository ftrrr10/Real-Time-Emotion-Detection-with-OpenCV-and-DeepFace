# Real-Time-Emotion-Detection-with-OpenCV-and-DeepFace
This project is a simple application for detecting human emotions in real-time using a webcam. The program captures video, detects faces within the feed, and analyzes the facial expressions to determine the dominant emotion.

Key Features:
Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascades from OpenCV to locate faces within the video frame.
Emotion Analysis: Leverages the DeepFace library to recognize key emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.
Live Visualization: Displays a bounding box around the detected face and overlays the recognized emotion as text directly onto the video stream.

Tech Stack:
Python
OpenCV
DeepFace
